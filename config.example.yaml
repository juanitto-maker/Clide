# ============================================
# Clide Configuration (~/.clide/config.yaml)
# ============================================
# Copy this file to ~/.clide/config.yaml and edit.
# The installer does this automatically.
#
# SECRETS MANAGEMENT:
#   For a cleaner separation of config vs. secrets, copy
#   secrets.example.yaml → ~/.clide/secrets.yaml and put all API keys there.
#   Clide loads secrets.yaml on top of this file; env vars override both.
#   Priority: env var > secrets.yaml > config.yaml > default
#
#   Any key in secrets.yaml (or env) is also available as ${KEY_NAME}
#   inside skill commands — injected at execution time, never sent to the AI.

# Gemini API key (get one free at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
# Recommended: leave empty here and set GEMINI_API_KEY in secrets.yaml.
gemini_api_key: ""

# Gemini model to use
gemini_model: "gemini-2.5-flash"

# Which messaging platform(s) to use:
#   "matrix"   - Element/Matrix only
#   "telegram"  - Telegram only
#   "both"      - run both simultaneously
platform: "matrix"

# --- Matrix/Element settings ---

# Homeserver URL (e.g. https://matrix.org or your own server)
matrix_homeserver: "https://matrix.org"

# Your Matrix user ID (e.g. @username:matrix.org)
matrix_user: "@username:matrix.org"

# Access token for the bot account.
# Obtained automatically by the installer, or set via MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN env var.
# Manual: POST https://matrix.org/_matrix/client/v3/login with your credentials.
# IMPORTANT: Keep the double quotes — tokens often contain characters that break YAML without them.
matrix_access_token: ""

# Room ID the bot listens in (e.g. !abc123:matrix.org)
# Find it in Element: Room Settings -> Advanced -> Internal room ID
# IMPORTANT: Keep the double quotes — the '!' and ':' characters require quoting in YAML.
matrix_room_id: "!roomid:matrix.org"

# --- Telegram settings ---

# Bot token from @BotFather (required when platform is "telegram" or "both")
# Recommended: set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN in secrets.yaml instead.
# To create a bot: open Telegram → @BotFather → /newbot → copy the token
telegram_bot_token: ""

# --- Additional AI provider keys ---
# These are used by skills (e.g. aiwb_manager) that route to other providers.
# Recommended: set these in secrets.yaml as ANTHROPIC_API_KEY etc.
# They are also available as ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY} placeholders in any skill command.
anthropic_api_key: ""
openai_api_key: ""

# --- Bot behaviour ---

# If true, bot asks "YES to proceed?" before replying
require_confirmation: false

# How long (seconds) to wait for YES/NO reply
confirmation_timeout: 60

# !! REQUIRED FOR SECURITY !! — Clide controls a real shell.
# An empty list BLOCKS ALL incoming messages (fail-closed).
# Add the Matrix user IDs / Telegram usernames that may give commands.
#
# Matrix example:   - "@youraccount:matrix.org"
# Telegram example: - "yourusername"   (no @, no quotes needed)
#
# You MUST fill this in or the bot will silently reject every message.
authorized_users:
  - "@youraccount:matrix.org"   # ← replace with your real user ID

# Shell command patterns to block (executor safety)
blocked_commands:
  - "rm -rf /"
  - "mkfs"
  - "dd if="
